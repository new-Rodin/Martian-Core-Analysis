# Martian-Core-Analysis
This project is the final submission and sums up all the work done under the Kriti 2025 Astronomy Project "Martian Core Analysis". Which was mostly based on the theoretical and conceptual understanding of P and S waves, their propagation, behaviour, shadow zones, and the overall implementation of a huge data set and simulations to finally arrive at getting the state and the size of Martian Core. This project included 9 modules in total out of which 5 were theoretical and were more on the material physics research oriented side, whereas the later 4 were based on ML implementation, using linear regression models to predict the core radius, detecting anomalies in the seismic data and finally creating a 3D simulation of Mars itself. The reports and other relevant visualisations and simulations which were a neccessity have been uploaded in the respective modules. The modules can be navigated via the File Structure.md file which is hopefully just above the README.md file.
