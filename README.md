# Martian-Core-Analysis
This projects hightlights and sums up all the work done under the Kriti 2025 Astronomy Project "Martian Core Analysis". Which was mostly based on the theoretical and conceptual understanding of P and S waves, their propagation, behaviour, shadow zones, and the overall implementation of a huge data set and simulations to finally arrive at the desired output. This project included 9 modules in total out of which 5 were theoretical and were more on the material physics research oriented side whereas the later 4 were based on ML implementation, using llinear regression models to predict the core radius, detecting anomalies in the seismic data and finally creating a 3D simulation of Mars itself. Since the first 5 modules are just theoretical and are easy enough to read and comprehend so it requires no documentation while for the latter 4 modules the documentation is given as follows:
